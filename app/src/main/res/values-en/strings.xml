        <b>1. How to start?</b>\n
You need to start by creating a new Household.\n
- The logic of the application design was built on an assumption that a user would need to managet counters for more than one apartment. Counters should be created and managed inside the household they are referenced to.\n
\n
<b>2. What is a Day-Night counter?</b>\n
- This type of counter calculates your resource consumption during the day and the night time. Day-Night counter is usually used with a different tariff, where price for resources consumed during the night time is lower than during the day time.\n
\n
<b>3. Exporting and importing CSV backup files. </b>\n
- First thing you need to remember is that backup files for Day-Night counter is different that a backup file for any other counter you can create and manage.\n
\n
- You can import any CSV and txt files that adhere to the following structure and requirements:\n
First row of every importing file is skipped, since it usually contains table headers.\n
The Day-Night import file should have the following rows and they should go in the following order:\n
-Date,\n
-prev data Day,\n
-prev data Night,\n
-current data Day,\n
-current data Night,\n
-day consumption,\n
-night consumption,\n
-regular tariff payment,\n
-amount saved,\n
-actual payment amount\n

Import file for every other counter should have the following rows and they should go in the following order:\n
-Date,\n
-prev Data,\n
-current Data,\n
-amount consumed,\n
-payment\n
Export and import file should use , (comma) as a row separator
